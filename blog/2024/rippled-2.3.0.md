# Introducing XRP Ledger version 2.3.0

Version 2.3.0 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release includes 8 new amendments, including Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs), Credentials, Clawback support for AMMs, and the ability to make offers as part of minting NFTs. Additionally, this release includes important fixes for stability, so server operators are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.


## Action Required

If you run an XRP Ledger server, upgrade to version 2.3.0 as soon as possible to ensure service continuity.

Additionally, new amendments are now open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](../../docs/concepts/networks-and-servers/amendments.md), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of >80% support from trusted validators. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.

## Install / Upgrade

On supported platforms, see the [instructions on installing or updating `rippled`](../../docs/infrastructure/installation/index.md).

{% admonition type="info" name="Note" %}
The packages in the stable repository were accidentally overwritten with a different build from the same source code as a result of version 2.3.0 being merged to both the `release` and `master` source code branches. This post has been updated with the new package hashes based on the packages currently available in the stable branch of each repository. The previous package hashes, below, are also acceptable, and represent the same release:
