## How CoinPayments Leverages XRPL Technology for Payments

CoinPayments utilizes XRP Ledger (XRPL) — a decentralized, fast, and low-cost platform — for processing crypto transactions. 

XRPL's [consensus algorithm](/docs/concepts/consensus-protocol) enables near-instant settlement of transactions. This significantly reduces latency and ensures high reliability, which is critical for businesses handling real-time payments.

### Crypto Payment Processing for eCommerce Merchants

CoinPayments translates XRPL's technical capabilities into tangible products and services. The platform uses XRPL to power shopping cart plugins that allow merchants to accept crypto payments seamlessly on e-commerce platforms. Payment buttons embedded on websites are backed by XRPL's fast transaction finality, offering customers smooth checkout experiences.

### API-First Integration for Custom Payment Workflows

Furthermore, Coinpayment exposes XRPL’s [API](/docs/references/http-websocket-apis)-first nature, allowing businesses to integrate custom payment workflows, manage wallets, and automate transactions, hence providing flexibility for developers. 

### Secure Custodial Wallets & Multi-Party Computation

CoinPayments integrates with XRPL to offer features like fiat offramps, payment forwarding, and automated crypto conversions, leveraging XRPL’s fast, reliable transactions. Its custodial wallet services also utilize XRPL’s secure architecture, enhanced with [multi-party computation (MPC)](../2024/web3auth#mpc-and-xrp-ledger-a-perfect-match) for added security and risk reduction.


## Value Proposition: Why Businesses Choose CoinPayments on XRPL 

### Substantial Cost Savings on XRP Ledger Transaction Fees Versus Traditional Money Transfers

One significant advantage for merchants using CoinPayments on XRPL is the substantial savings on transaction fees. The current minimum transaction cost on the XRP Ledger is 0.00001 XRP, equivalent to approximately 0.000314 USD (as of July 2025). This minimal fee is primarily designed to prevent spam and ensure network sustainability, making it significantly cheaper than traditional payment methods.

For example, domestic wire transfers through traditional money transfer providers can cost between [$20 and $35](https://www.westernunion.com/blog/en/us/how-much-are-money-transfer-fees/?cust_src=organic_search) for outgoing transfers, while incoming transfers may still incur fees ranging from $0 to $16. Similarly, credit card processing fees typically range from [0.7% to 3.4% per transaction](https://www.zigaflow.com/post/credit-card-charges-might-be-changing-here-s-why#:~:text=In%2DPerson%20Transactions:%20For%20businesses,to%20%C2%A320%20per%20month.) for in-person payments, which can add up quickly for businesses handling high volumes. 
By leveraging XRPL's low-cost transaction model, merchants can reduce overhead expenses related to payment processing, thereby improving profit margins and enabling more competitive pricing for their customers.


### Global Accessibility with Customer Reach Across 180+ Countries

In addition to cost savings, CoinPayments, powered by XRPL, provides merchants with access to a global customer base. The ability to accept crypto payments from anywhere in the world eliminates the barriers associated with traditional banking systems, such as cross-border fees and currency conversion costs. Such global access allows merchants to expand their reach, serve a broader audience, and tap into new revenue streams, ultimately supporting business growth and diversification.

### Critical Compliance and Security for Digital Transactions

Security and compliance are critical considerations for businesses handling digital transactions. XRPL's payment functionalities are ledger-native and immutable, inheriting the robust security features of the XRP Ledger itself. The XRPL has operated since 2012, providing unparalleled reliability and ensuring continuous uptime for merchants. 
CoinPayments complements XRPL's inherent security by operating as a licensed payment institution, offering crypto payment services in a compliant manner. Therefore, merchants using CoinPayments do not have to worry about navigating complex regulatory requirements or managing security risks independently. 

The combination of XRPL's secure, reliable infrastructure and CoinPayments' compliance framework provides merchants with a trustworthy solution for handling crypto transactions safely and within regulatory guidelines.

### Business Traction and Impact on the XRP Ledger
CoinPayments has processed thousands of transactions amounting to millions in XRP volume moved, across various industries, highlighting the practical impact of XRPL technology in real-world applications. 
This adoption spans a range of industries, with notable traction in Software Services & Development and Gaming, while Web Hosting, Advertising, Marketing, and E-commerce contribute smaller shares. Geographically, CoinPayments’ reach includes over 180 countries.

## Conclusion: XRPL Enables Secure, Fast, and Cost-Effective Payment Processing for CoinPayments
CoinPayments demonstrates how XRPL technology can be effectively integrated into payment solutions, translating blockchain's technical strengths into user-friendly products. This case study highlights XRPL's role not just as an underlying protocol but as an enabler of secure, fast, and cost-effective payment systems for businesses worldwide.
