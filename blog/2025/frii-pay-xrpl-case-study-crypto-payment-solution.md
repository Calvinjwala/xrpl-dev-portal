## How Frii Pay Utilizes XRPL Technology for Payments

Frii Pay’s core infrastructure is purpose-built on the XRP Ledger, leveraging its decentralized, fast, and scalable blockchain environment to deliver seamless payment experiences.

### Key ways Frii Pay leverages XRPL

* **[Stablecoin Payments](/docs/use-cases/tokenization/stablecoin-issuer)**: Frii Pay issues and supports [multiple stablecoins](https://ripple.com/insights/the-rise-of-global-stablecoins-on-the-xrpl/) (e.g. RLUSD) directly on the XRPL, ensuring price-stable crypto payments while maintaining high transaction speed and low fees.

* **Instant Settlement Layer**: Utilizing XRPL's average settlement time of 3-5 seconds, Frii Pay enables real-time cross-border and domestic payments without intermediaries.

* **On-Ledger Tokenization**: Frii Pay uses [XRPL’s native tokenization features](/docs/use-cases/tokenization/real-world-assets) to issue coupons and loyalty rewards in the form of merchant-specific tokens or digital money, creating new and engaging consumer interactions by unlocking the programmable finance capabilities of the XRPL.

* **Real-time Currency Conversion**: Frii Pay utilizes the XRPL’s [Decentralized Exchange (DEX)](/docs/concepts/tokens/decentralized-exchange) to enable consumers to pay using any tradable currency in their wallet, while ensuring the merchant receives the exact currency and amount they have requested.

* **Compliance**: Frii Pay’s architecture incorporates XRPL’s compliance-ready infrastructure, facilitating KYC/AML-integrated payment rails that can interact with traditional financial systems to on and off ramp funds for all users.


## Benefits of XRPL for Payment Companies like Frii Pay

Frii Pay’s value proposition revolves around providing frictionless, stable, and cost-effective payment infrastructure to businesses, powered by XRPL.

In addition, the application leverages consumer spending data with the real-time, cross-border capabilities of XRPL to introduce new and interesting payment experiences that benefit merchants, consumers, and even brands.

Imagine spending $100 on a meal and having your $10 loyalty discount sent instantly to a wallet on the other side of the world to pay for a gift, medical treatment, or education.


### How XRPL Adds Value to Frii Pay’s Crypto Payment Solution



Frii Pay abstracts blockchain complexity for businesses by providing merchant SDKs, customer-facing wallets, payment APIs, settlement & reconciliation dashboards. This allows merchants to accept crypto payments without technical blockchain expertise while tapping into XRPL’s efficiency. They have also expanded their solution to support payments online and via unattended kiosks.
