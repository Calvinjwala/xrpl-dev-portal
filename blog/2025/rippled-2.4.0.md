# Introducing XRP Ledger version 2.4.0

Version 2.4.0 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release adds new features and bug fixes, and introduces these amendments:

- `PermissionedDomains`
- `DeepFreeze`
- `DynamicNFT`
- `fixFrozenLPTokenTransfer`
- `fixInvalidTxFlags`


## Notable Updates: New Public Key Provided by the new XRPL Foundation

Following the recent announcement regarding the [move to the new XRPL Foundation](./move-to-the-new-xrpl-foundation-commences.md), the XRPL Foundation members have been working diligently to facilitate a smooth transition of the Unique Node List (UNL) from the old XRPL Foundation to the new XRPL Foundation.

There are two key goals driving this transition:
- Ensure continued network participation and avoid potential downtime.
- Allow for a staged migration with minimal impact on validators and node operators.

Keeping these goals in mind, a new subdomain, **unl.xrplf.org**, has been introduced alongside the existing list at **vl.xrplf.org**. This approach allows for a staged migration without modifying the key for the current UNL list. Eventually, vl.xrplf.org will be fully deprecated and replaced by unl.xrplf.org.

In `rippled` release 2.4.0, the `validators-example.txt` file has been updated to include the new public key published by the new XRPL Foundation.

Further information on the transition will be shared by the XRPL Foundation in the near future.


## Action Required

If you run an XRP Ledger server, upgrade to version 2.4.0 as soon as possible to ensure service continuity.

Additionally, new amendments are now open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](../../docs/concepts/networks-and-servers/amendments.md), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of >80% support from trusted validators. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.


## Install / Upgrade

On supported platforms, see the [instructions on installing or updating `rippled`](../../docs/infrastructure/installation/index.md).
