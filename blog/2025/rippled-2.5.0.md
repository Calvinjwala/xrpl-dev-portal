# Introducing XRP Ledger version 2.5.0

Version 2.5.0 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release adds new features and bug fixes, and introduces these amendments:

- `TokenEscrow`
- `Batch`
- `PermissionedDEX`
- `PermissionDelegation`
- `AMMv1_3`
- `EnforceNFTokenTrustlineV2`
- `PayChanCancelAfter`


## Action Required

If you run an XRP Ledger server, upgrade to version 2.5.0 as soon as possible to ensure service continuity.

Additionally, new amendments are now open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](../../docs/concepts/networks-and-servers/amendments.md), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of >80% support from trusted validators. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.


## Install / Upgrade

On supported platforms, see the [instructions on installing or updating `rippled`](../../docs/infrastructure/installation/index.md).
