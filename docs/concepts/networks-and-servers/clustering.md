# Clustering

Clustering is a configuration operation for `rippled` servers that improves efficiency among mutually trusted servers. Clustering should only be used for servers that are located within the same datacenter and are operated by the same organization. Clustering provides the following benefits:

- Clustered servers share the work of cryptography. If one server has verified the authenticity of a message, the other servers in the cluster trust it and do not re-verify.
- Clustered servers share information about peers and API clients that are misbehaving or abusing the network. This makes it harder to attack all servers of the cluster at once.
- Clustered servers always propagate transactions throughout the cluster, even if the transaction does not meet the current load-based transaction fee on some of them.

If you are running a validator as a [private peer](peer-protocol.md#private-peers), it's recommended to run a cluster of servers as proxies, since a cluster is more resilient to failure than individual servers.
