# Update Manually on Ubuntu or Debian

This page describes how to update manually to the latest release of `rippled` on Ubuntu Linux. You can also up [automatic updates](update-rippled-automatically-on-linux.md).

These instructions assume you have already [installed `rippled` on a supported version of Ubuntu using Ripple's `deb` package](install-rippled-on-ubuntu.md). If you are upgrading from `rippled` 1.6.x or older, remove it and perform a fresh install instead.

{% admonition type="success" name="Tip" %}To perform these steps all at once, you can run the `/opt/ripple/bin/update-rippled.sh` script, which is included with the `rippled` package and is compatible with Ubuntu and Debian. This script should be run as a `sudo` user.{% /admonition %}

To update manually, complete the following steps:

1. Update repositories:

    ```
    sudo apt -y update
    ```

2. Upgrade the `rippled` package:

    ```
    sudo apt -y upgrade rippled
    ```

3. Reload the `systemd` unit files:

    ```
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

4. Restart the `rippled` service:

    ```
    sudo systemctl restart rippled
    ```
